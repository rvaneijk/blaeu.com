Breuer and Van Zeeland took groups of citizens on physical tours of smart city infrastructure in three Belgian cities, stopping at cameras, sensors, and smart bins to gauge public reactions. Over 14 walks with more than 100 participants revealed that transparency notices are largely ineffective and that citizens care more about the purpose of data collection than technical compliance details. The project found that citizen feedback can enrich DPIAs by replacing office-based expert assessment with grounded democratic input. Van Eijk highlights privacy-friendly alternatives such as infrared sensors that count cyclists without capturing images.",

The segment examines the privacy risks of smartphone apps that collect sensitive health data, from fitness trackers and step counters to symptom checkers and medication reminders. Van Eijk provides expert commentary on how data collected by consumer health apps can flow to advertising networks and data brokers without users realising it. The interview covers what checks consumers can apply and what regulatory obligations apply to app developers under Dutch and European law.",

Rob van Eijk highlights the IRMA identity app as an example of attribute-based credentials that let users prove a specific claim without revealing full identity. Gloria González Fuster, Gwendal Le Grand, Katharina Koerner, and Naomi Lefkovitz discuss how the book bridges the language gap between lawyers and engineers, and why regulation is essential to incentivise privacy-by-design in practice.",

Van Eijk walks through how a retailer's operations depend on dozens of interconnected cloud services for hosting, analytics, CDN delivery, fraud detection, and authentication, each potentially operated by a different global vendor. The online learning scenario adds edge-cached video conferencing and integrated learning management systems. The discussion addresses the Schrems II decision and the practical difficulty of strict data localisation, concluding that modern digital services are built on globally intertwined technology stacks that cannot easily be separated by geography.",

Van Eijk draws on his experience at the Dutch Data Protection Authority and in W3C negotiations to explain why the Do Not Track initiative failed to achieve voluntary industry compliance. The conversation examines what structural changes are necessary for online advertising to operate sustainably alongside privacy protections, and what a technically grounded regulatory approach looks like from an insider perspective.",

Rob van Eijk and Gabriela Zanfir-Fortuna discuss how the CJEU uses privacy rulings to assert institutional authority and how the Snowden revelations enabled Max Schrems to dismantle Safe Harbor. The panel concludes that the current landscape is defined by deep uncertainty and politically entrenched positions that make compromise exceptionally difficult.",
