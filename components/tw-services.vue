            We help courts and lawyers understand complex technology systems by explaining how they
            work in clear, understandable terms for legal proceedings and regulatory decisions.

          <p>
            We act like "ethical hackers" to find weaknesses in AI privacy protections before bad
            actors can exploit them. This includes testing systems that protect personal data and
            learning algorithms to ensure they're truly secure.

          <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Blue Team AI Security Partnerships</h3>
          <p>
            We work with organizations to build stronger privacy protections into their AI systems
            in two ways: (1) Creating measurement tools to assess privacy risks and ensure AI
            systems are deployed safely (2) Building communication rules for when agentic AI systems
            talk to each other, ensuring privacy and security aren't compromised as these systems
            become more autonomous.
